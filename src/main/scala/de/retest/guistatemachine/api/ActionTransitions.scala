/**
  * Represents transitions for one single symbol which is represented by an `de.retest.surili.commons.actions.Action` to a number of states.
  * The corresponding symbol is not stored in this class but in the [[State]] from which the transitions are started.
  *
  * @param to The states which the transitions lead to. Since it is a NFA, there can be multiple states for the same symbol.
  * @param executionCounter The number of times all transitions for the action have been executed from the corresponding state.
  *                         It does not matter to which state. In the legacy code this was stored as `StateGraph.executionCounter`.
