# GUI State Machine API

API for the creation and modification of nondeterministic finite automaton for the automatic generation of GUI tests with the help of a genetic algorithm.
Basically, it does only provide only the two calls `getState` and `executeAction`.

## Automatic Build with TravisCI
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/retest/gui-state-machine-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/retest/gui-state-machine-api)

## Dependencies

Make sure to have configured the ReTest Repositories in `~/.sbt/repositories`:
```
[repositories]
  local
  maven-central
  nexus-retest-maven-all: https://nexus.retest.org/repository/all/
  nexus-retest-maven-surili-snapshot: https://nexus.retest.org/repository/surili-snapshot/
```

Define the credentials `export SBT_CREDENTIALS="$HOME/.sbt/.credentials"` when building.

## SBT Commands
* `sbt compile` to build the project manually.
* `sbt run` to start the REST service.
* `sbt assembly` to create a standalone JAR which includes all dependencies including the Scala libraries. The standalone JAR is generated as `target/scala-<scalaversion>/gui-state-machine-api-assembly-<version>.jar`.
* `sbt eclipse` to generate a project for Eclipse.
* `sbt test` to execute all unit tests.
* `sbt coverage` to generate coverage data.
* `sbt coverageReport` to generate a HTML coverage report.
* `sbt scalastyle` to make a check with ScalaStyle.
* `sbt doc` to generate the scaladoc API documentation.
* `sbt scalafmt` to format the Scala source files with scalafmt.
* `sbt 'release cross with-defaults'` to create a release with a new version number which is added as tag. This command does also publish the artifacts.
* `sbt publish` publishes the artifacts in ReTest's Nexus. Requires a `$HOME/.sbt/.credentials` file with the correct credentials. This command can be useful to publish SNAPSHOT versions.

## NFA for the Representation of Tests
A nondeterministic finite automaton represents the states of the GUI during the test.
The actions executed by the user on the widgets are represented by transitions.
If an action has not been executed yet from a state, it leads to an unknown state.
The unknown state is a special state from which all actions could be executed.
The NFA is based on the UI model from [Search-Based System Testing: High Coverage, No False Alarms](http://www.specmate.org/papers/2012-07-Search-basedSystemTesting-HighCoverageNoFalseAlarms.pdf) (section "4.5 UI Model").
Whenever an unknown state is replaced by a newly discovered state, the NFA has to be updated.

The NFA is used to generate test cases (sequence of UI actions) with the help of a genetic algorithm.
For example, whenever a random action is executed with the help of monkey testing, it adds a transition to the state machine.
After running the genetic algorithm, the state machine is then used to create a test suite.

## Scala API for GUI State Machines
The package [api](./src/main/scala/de/retest/guistatemachine/api) contains all types and methods for getting and modifying the GUI state machine.

## REST API
At the moment there is only an initial version of a REST API which has to be mapped to the Scala API.
The REST service can be started with `sbt run`.
It has the address `http://localhost:8888/`.
The REST API can be tested manually with `curl`:
```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8888/state-machine
```

### Swagger Support
The Swagger support is based on [swagger-akka-http](https://github.com/swagger-akka-http/swagger-akka-http).
The URL `http://localhost:8888/api-docs/swagger.json` should produce Swagger JSON output which can be rendered by [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).
