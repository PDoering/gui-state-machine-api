# GUI State Machine API

Service for the creation and modification of state machines of GUI tests based on a genetic algorithm.
This [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) service stores the NFA in a [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database).
The service hides the actual implementation and defines a fixed interface for calls.
Therefore, calling systems do not depend on the concrete implementation and it can be mocked easily for tests.

## Manual Build
Use the command `sbt compile` to build the project manually.

## Model Notation
An [NFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton) represents the states of the GUI.
The transitions are possible GUI actions.
The model is based on the UI model from [Search-Based System Testing: High Coverage, No False Alarms][] (section "4.5 UI Model").
Whenever an unknown state is replaced by a newly discovered state, the model is updated.

Open questions:

* state machine != NFA != graph? It is definitely an NFA since multiple outoing transitions are allowed.
* REST -> HTTP what about the performance? Alternatively use a direct API in Scala? Should be possible from Java: <https://lampwww.epfl.ch/~michelou/scala/using-scala-from-java.html>
* What kind of analysises on the state machines are required except for the next possible actions?
* Whenever a new state is discovered, is the transition to the unknown state removed? Couldn't there be more states to be discovered? Doesn't matter?
* EFG model?
* How should the differences of the different versions of the state machines be stored?
* The demo of Retest allows recording and replaying tests. The same can be done with <https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/>, so benefits are the automatic test generation/training and the difference testing?

## Legacy code
The package `de.retest.graph` contains all legacy classes.
The package exists in version with GIT tag `retest-2.4.1`.

## Definitions
These definitions have been made by Furrer in his master's thesis.
See section `2.3.1 Problemrepräsentation` for a detailed definition of the SUT model.
The primary source for the definitions is [Exploring Realistic Program Behavior](https://www.st.cs.uni-
saarland.de/publications/files/fgross-tr-2012.pdf).

### Test Suite
A test suite is a set of test cases.

### Test Case
A test case is a sequence of UI actions.

### UI Action
A UI action is an action which can be triggert by the user via the GUI.

### UI Path
A UI path is a sequence of states with transitions from one state to another.
Each transition is a UI action.

### State
A state is defined by the set of all visible and interactable windows together with their enabled widgets.

## REST API
Some suggestions on how the REST API could look like.

state/create
Parameter:
List(windows):
- window:
- id
- parent
- List(InteractableComponent):
-- label

action/create
Parameter:
- state from
- state to
There is a special ID for the unknown state.

action/update
- state to

action/delete
Infeasible actions must be deleted before their actual execution.

Edges to the unknown state might lead to another state after some tests.

Simplified REST API for automatic tests which discover new states and transitions:
state/add
Parameter:
- State-Parameter
- Source State

Automatically, a transition to the unknown state.

## REST Frameworks for Scala
* <https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/>
* <https://www.playframework.com/>
* <https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/6izqac/akka_http_vs_play_ws_what_is_the_current_state/>
* <https://slides.com/leonardoregnier/deck#/>
* <https://nordicapis.com/8-frameworks-to-build-a-web-api-in-scala/>
* Replaced by Akka HTTP: <http://spray.io/>

If REST is too slow, Scala can still be called directly via Java.

## NFA Frameworks
TODO Add some.
